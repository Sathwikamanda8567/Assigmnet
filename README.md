This project is a web-based cricket scoreboard viewer featuring separate "Admin" and "User" views. Admins can manage and track detailed over-by-over updates, while users can see simplified live score updates with animated ball highlights. The UI is fully responsive and provides an engaging way to visualize cricket scores.
